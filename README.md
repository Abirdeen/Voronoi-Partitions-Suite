## Features

### Current
Voronoi currently has the following features:

- Nothing, this is the initial version

### Future
Voronoi plans to add the following features:

- Generating Voronoi partitions in suitable metric spaces, via any computable probability distribution
- Voronoi data sampling for suitable metric spaces
- Visualisations of Voronoi diagrams in suitable metric spaces
- Statistical analysis of properties, both for a given process and for analysing particular kinds of process
